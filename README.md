### Project Description
The Peter Griffin Excuse Generator is a humor-driven web app that generates witty, over-the-top excuses for various situations inspired by the iconic character Peter Griffin. Users can choose from preset categories like "Late to Work" or "Missed Assignment," or input a custom prompt to receive a unique, sarcastic excuse. Featuring a playful interface, voice playback, and plenty of comedic flair, this app delivers a quick laugh and a perfect "Peter-approved" excuse for every occasion!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever found yourself in desperate need of a hilarious, wildly implausible excuse for being late, forgetting an important date, or dodging an event? In a world filled with unimaginative explanations, we're solving the (nonexistent) problem of excuse blandness. With the Peter Griffin Excuse Generator, you‚Äôll never again have to settle for a boring ‚ÄúI forgot.‚Äù Instead, let Peter himself supply you with the most outrageous, unforgettable excuses, perfect for when reality just doesn‚Äôt cut it!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre tackling the global epidemic of boring excuses with the Peter Griffin Excuse Generator! Powered by Peter‚Äôs unique sense of humor (and some clever code), our app serves up absurd, laugh-out-loud excuses for every occasion. Just pick a category‚Äîor get creative with a custom prompt‚Äîand let Peter deliver an excuse so hilarious, it might actually work. Need to blame a pet raccoon, a time-travel mishap, or an alien abduction? We've got you covered. This is the ultimate tool for anyone who wants their excuses to leave people both baffled and entertained!

![Workflow]![excuse_generator_corrected_linear_workflow_diagram (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a92dfda0-ee2f-41ec-9d9c-b376a671c5de)

This workflow diagram illustrates the interaction between the user interface, the Flask backend, and the Together API. Users can choose a category or enter a custom prompt, which is sent to the Flask server. The server processes the request, communicates with the Together API to generate an excuse, and then returns the response to the user interface for display. Additionally, the text-to-speech feature allows users to hear the generated excuses
